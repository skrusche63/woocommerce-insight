## WooCommerce Insight 

[WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce) is the most popular WordPress eCommerce plugin and, out of the box, provides a 
large set of features to manage an online store. 

Running a store for a while, however, leads to questions about optimizing business performance. The key to respond to this demand is 
improved customer understanding.

This is where [**Predictiveworks.**](http://predictiveworsk.eu) comes into play. It is an open source Data Mining & Prediction platform,
that brings the power of advanced predictions and recommendations to small and mid-size companies.

**WooCommerce Insight** provides a bridge between WooCommerce and Predictiveworks. and makes it easy for WooCommerce users to apply 
MarketBasket Analysis to their orders, compute Product Recommendations and more.
